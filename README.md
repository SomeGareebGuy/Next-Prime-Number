# Next-Prime-Number
Hi!
This program is designed to show you the next prime number starting from 2.
You can press enter to see the next number or else you can press e to exit.
Input() is added in the last line in order to prevent the program from immediately closing.
Feel free to reccomend any suggestions to improve the program.
